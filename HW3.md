Exercise 1: 

Part A:

2 random numbers the oracle generated:

1st: 41980747347925684095664142244582802399345400813320824292508083965355107587430

2nd: 41980747347925684095664142244582802399345400813320824292508083965355107587430

Explain information each of these fields conveys:
 
RequestSent:

requestId (uint256):

A unique identifier for the random number request. It is used to track the status and results of the request.

numWords (uint32):

The number of random words (numbers) requested from the Chainlink VRF. Determines how many random numbers the oracle will return.

RequestFulfilled:

requestId (uint256): Matches the requestId from RequestSent and confirms which request this fulfillment corresponds to.

randomWords (uint256[]): An array containing the random numbers generated by the Chainlink VRF. The number of elements matches the numWords specified in RequestSent.

paid (uint256): The amount of LINK tokens paid for fulfilling the request.

fulfilled (bool): Indicates whether the request was successfully completed, true if the random numbers were successfully generated and returned.

caller (address): The address of the account that initiated the random number request.

blockNumber (uint256): The block number at which the request was fulfilled, providing a reference for the blockchain transaction's timestamp.

Part C: 

There are two main ways to use Chainlink VRF: Direct Funding VRF and Subscription VRF. Each works differently and suits different needs.

Direct Funding VRF requires the smart contract to pay for each request separately. LINK tokens must be sent directly to the VRF contract before requesting a random number. This method works well for small projects that don’t need randomness often. It gives full control over spending but comes with extra steps. The contract must always have enough LINK, and gas costs can add up since each request involves a new transaction.

Subscription VRF works differently. Instead of handling payments for each request, a separate account holds LINK. Multiple contracts can request random numbers from the same account as long as it has enough LINK. This setup is a better fit for projects that need randomness regularly, like blockchain games or NFT minting. It lowers gas fees and removes the need to manage LINK in every contract. However, setting up a subscription takes more effort and might not be worth it for smaller applications.

Each method has its place. Direct Funding VRF makes sense for projects with occasional randomness needs and careful cost tracking. Subscription VRF works better for those that need randomness often and want to keep things efficient.

Exercise 2:

Part A 

MakerDAO is a force in DeFi. It built the Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model, where users lock up crypto to borrow against it. DAI, its stablecoin, powers much of decentralized finance. But the competition is fierce. Liquity, Curve Finance, Davos, Ramp— they all offer different takes on CDPs. Some promise lower liquidation thresholds. Others tweak interest rates. Some build unique liquidation models. The question is simple: where does MakerDAO stand today?

The answer lies in data. DefiLlama and Dune Analytics give a clear picture. First, Total Value Locked (TVL)—a crucial metric. MakerDAO sits at $6.2 billion as of February 2025. It’s the undisputed leader in CDPs. Liquity trails behind with just $1.3 billion. Other players hold even less. Maker isn’t just surviving; it’s thriving.

DAI’s supply stands at $5.4 billion. That’s massive. It competes with giants like USDT and USDC. But unlike them, DAI isn’t controlled by a single entity. That makes it a go-to stablecoin for those who value decentralization.

Then there’s yield. MakerDAO offers 2.5% on staked DAI through the DAI Savings Rate (DSR). It’s a conservative return. Safer than Curve. Less aggressive than Aave. Yet, it attracts steady depositors. Meanwhile, liquidations tell another story. In 2024 alone, MakerDAO liquidations raked in over $50 million in penalties. That’s both a safeguard and a business model. Under-collateralized positions are purged, and arbitrage traders rush in to profit.

Dune Analytics adds more depth. The average collateralization ratio across Maker vaults is 165%. That’s healthy. It shows users aren’t reckless. They’re managing risk. The number of daily active users has jumped 15% year-over-year. More users. More stability. More trust.

Key metrics from Lecture 5 reinforce this. TVL measures MakerDAO’s dominance. The Collateralization Ratio (CR) proves its resilience. These numbers don’t lie. MakerDAO is still the king of CDPs. But the DeFi space moves fast. If it doesn’t evolve, it could lose ground.

Part B 

MKR has gone through major changes since Black Thursday in March 2020. That event was a breaking point for MakerDAO. ETH prices collapsed, liquidations stalled, and the system failed to function properly. $4.5 million in unbacked DAI flooded the market, causing instability. MKR dropped from $540 to $260 as confidence in the protocol declined.

To correct these issues, MakerDAO introduced key improvements. Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD) was one of the biggest changes, allowing deposits of assets beyond ETH. With USDC, BTC, and LINK now part of the system, risk became more distributed. Another major fix was an upgrade to the Keeper System, which automated liquidations and prevented failures similar to Black Thursday. Governance participation also improved, with MKR holders given stronger incentives to engage in protocol decisions.

As a result of these upgrades, MKR’s price has climbed back to $1,250. The system now generates revenue from stability fees, liquidations, and user growth. Before Black Thursday, MKR served primarily as an emergency backstop. That role has expanded. Stability fees and penalties are now used to burn MKR, reducing supply and increasing long-term value. Governance is more active, creating a stronger foundation for future decision-making.

MKR is no longer just a fail-safe measure. It has become a key part of MakerDAO’s structure, reinforcing the protocol’s risk management and economic model. The shift from reactive governance to proactive oversight has helped strengthen MakerDAO’s long-term sustainability.

Part C 

MakerDAO is changing direction. It is moving forward under the name Sky. This shift is more than just branding. A new governance model is at the center of the change. The introduction of the SKY token marks a new phase for the protocol. Unlike MKR, SKY is designed to automate governance decisions, reducing the need for manual votes on every proposal.

For years, governance has been a challenge. MKR holders needed to vote on system changes, but participation was inconsistent. SKY aims to solve this problem with dynamic stability fees, allowing fee adjustments to happen without waiting for a vote. This could improve efficiency, making MakerDAO’s decision-making process smoother.

Technology will also play a role in the protocol’s future. AI-driven risk assessment could help MakerDAO prevent liquidations before they become a problem. This would make the system more resilient and reduce the chance of major failures like Black Thursday. At the same time, new risks are emerging. Quantum computing could compromise blockchain security. MakerDAO will need to prepare for this by adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions.

Another concern is regulation. Governments are paying closer attention to stablecoins, and decentralized protocols like MakerDAO will likely face new rules in the coming years. If MakerDAO can work within these legal frameworks while keeping its decentralized nature, DAI could become a preferred alternative to unstable national currencies. People in high-inflation economies might start using DAI for everyday transactions, increasing its adoption worldwide.

MakerDAO has recovered from serious crises before. Its ability to adapt has kept it relevant in DeFi. However, the future depends on how well it balances governance changes, security upgrades, and regulatory shifts. If it handles these areas well, it may continue to be one of the most important decentralized lending protocols in the years ahead.
