Exercise 1: 

Part A:

2 random numbers the oracle generated:

1st: 41980747347925684095664142244582802399345400813320824292508083965355107587430

2nd: 41980747347925684095664142244582802399345400813320824292508083965355107587430

Explain information each of these fields conveys:
 
RequestSent:

requestId (uint256):

A unique identifier for the random number request. It is used to track the status and results of the request.

numWords (uint32):

The number of random words (numbers) requested from the Chainlink VRF. Determines how many random numbers the oracle will return.

RequestFulfilled:

requestId (uint256): Matches the requestId from RequestSent and confirms which request this fulfillment corresponds to.

randomWords (uint256[]): An array containing the random numbers generated by the Chainlink VRF. The number of elements matches the numWords specified in RequestSent.

paid (uint256): The amount of LINK tokens paid for fulfilling the request.

fulfilled (bool): Indicates whether the request was successfully completed, true if the random numbers were successfully generated and returned.

caller (address): The address of the account that initiated the random number request.

blockNumber (uint256): The block number at which the request was fulfilled, providing a reference for the blockchain transaction's timestamp.

Exercise 2:

Part A

Overview of CDP Market

MakerDAO, as a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol, is a leader in decentralized finance. It allows users to lock collateral, such as ETH or BTC, to mint DAI, a decentralized stablecoin. Using insights from DefiLlama and Dune Analytics, MakerDAO's current standing is compared against its competitors such as Liquity, Curve Finance, and Davos Protocol.

From DefiLlama:
TVL (Total Value Locked): MakerDAO has a dominant TVL of over $6.2 billion (Feb 2025), representing a significant share of the CDP market. Liquity follows with $1.3 billion, while Curve and Davos contribute smaller portions.

DAI Metrics: DAI remains a top decentralized stablecoin with a market cap of $5.4 billion, competing with centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Its consistent growth reflects robust user adoption.

Liquidation Opportunities: Maker’s liquidations generated $50M in penalties during 2024, demonstrating the economic activity within its ecosystem.

From Dune Analytics:

Collateralization Ratio Trends: MakerDAO vaults maintain an average collateralization ratio of 165%, showcasing stability even during market volatility.
User Activity: Daily active addresses minting DAI have increased by 15% YoY, indicating growing adoption.

Metrics from Lecture 5:

Total Value Locked (TVL): As a core financial metric, TVL represents the value of assets locked in MakerDAO’s vaults, emphasizing its market dominance.
Collateralization Ratio (CR): With a minimum CR of 150%, MakerDAO ensures its system remains solvent and stable.

Part B

MKR Token’s Evolution

On Black Thursday (March 2020), ETH prices plummeted, leading to $4.5M in undercollateralized DAI. MKR’s value dropped from $540 to $260, highlighting systemic vulnerabilities. Key post-event changes include:

Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD): Maker introduced diverse collateral types (e.g., BTC, USDC), reducing reliance on ETH.
Keeper Upgrades: Automated liquidation systems (e.g., Bite Keepers) were enhanced to handle extreme volatility.
Governance Incentives: MKR holders were incentivized to participate in voting, improving protocol resilience.

Utility of MKR Token

Before Black Thursday, MKR had limited governance participation, as most holders were passive and did not actively engage in voting. Its primary function was as a backstop mechanism, used only during extreme emergencies to stabilize the system. Value appreciation was mainly dependent on the protocol's overall stability and growth.

After Black Thursday, MakerDAO implemented significant changes. Governance participation by MKR holders became actively incentivized, encouraging more involvement in decision-making. The token’s role as a backstop mechanism was expanded to include regular burning of stability fees and penalties, creating a deflationary effect. Value appreciation now benefits from increased revenue streams like stability fees, liquidations, and DAI adoption, making MKR a more integral part of the protocol’s long-term success.

Part C 

MakerDAO’s rebranding to Sky reflects its ambition to strengthen its ecosystem and expand globally. This strategic shift aims to decentralize governance further and optimize its tokenomics through the SKY token. Unlike MKR, SKY focuses on dynamic fee adjustments, improving system efficiency and transparency.
Future Challenges and Opportunities:

AI and Risk Management: AI-powered risk assessment tools could enhance MakerDAO’s stability and predict liquidation risks more accurately.
Quantum Computing: The rise of quantum technology necessitates transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems to maintain protocol security.
Global Adoption: DAI’s penetration into emerging markets offers a unique opportunity to address financial exclusion.

MakerDAO has successfully evolved since Black Thursday, positioning itself as a robust, decentralized protocol. Its future hinges on embracing technological innovation while addressing regulatory challenges.
